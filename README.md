If you come to this page from the GCards, it means you are a lucky friend of mine, and has received a gift card specially designed for you.

## Details

> The first time GCards is used, an alert pops up to enter the token. Or the token can be entered by visiting the site with 'get' params like this:
```console
XXX.com/?token={your token}
```
Then the token is automatially saved to cookie. So next time you visit, no pop-ups, no params, just directly visit the site.

The UI is copied from github, but I fixed some bugs and upgraded the project into a multi-user one with the token system and des-decryption, so it's rather hard to see others' cards without the token, even though all the source codes are exposed on the internet.
